MosfireSkyspec.tar contains calibrated night sky spectra obtained during the "second light" observing
run, 3-8 May 2012. 

The spectra are binned in the same way as the spectra come out for mosfire observations.  The files
<band>sky.eps.msdc.[dat,fits] gives the observed number of e- per second per pixel in one spatial pixel of
background spectrum, for an entrance slit of 0.7".  They are directly observed quantities, and so
have already been attenuated by the atmosphere and the mosfire+telescope system.  

The files <band>sky_cal_pA.fits is the same sky spectrum, converted to ergs/s/cm^2/A (i.e., flux calibrated
for a single spatial row for the 0.7" entrance slit. 

The files <band>sky_cal_pp.fits is the calibrated sky spectrum in units of ergs/s/cm^2/pixel instead (i.e., it
differs by the bin size in A for a spectral channel from the *_pA* files. 

For example, to obtain mag/arcsec^2 for the sky (vs. wavelength bin) one needs to multiply by 5.56*1.0/0.7=7.9,
where the factor 5.56 is the number of spatial pixels per arcsec^2, and the factor 1.0/0.7 corresponds to 
widening the slit to 1" from 0.7". 

Finally, the files oh_lines_*.txt are linelists for wavelength calibration, and identified spectra are in 
eps_<band>sky.ids.eps .
