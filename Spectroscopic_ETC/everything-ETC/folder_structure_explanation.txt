All the data has been put into etc_data and is now mixed together
 -If you want just the SAMOS data, there is a nother folder for it

etc_data:
    - everything has been restructures so it matches the code
    - this folder is mostly the same as just for atlas, the only change is that spec_throughput now includes the throughput for SAMOS also
    - i.e. the background (L2) is now in an L2 folder
